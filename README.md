## File Structure and Adding Code

The root directory has folders corresponding to the language in which the code was written.

```
root
|--java
|--python
|--typescript
|
. . .
```

JavaScript code is in the `typescript` folder

The `transpiled-ts` folder is for transpiled typescript from the `typescript` folder **Do NOT edit anything in this folder**

## General Guidelines

Problems are grouped into files by problem type and difficulty. 

Each file will contain multiple problems, each as their own function(s)/method(s).

Begin each problem with a heading comment with the exact name of the problem. Best to refrain from using any other comments unless necessary.

For class-based languages, write one encompassing class for all problems in a file, and each problem is it's own method.

## Language Specific Guidelines

### Java

Write one class, "Solutions", per file, and each problem should be a public method

Any other class declarations should be put above the main "Solutions" class.

### Python

Write one class with each problem being a method of this class

Any other class declarations should be put at the top of the file, before the main class.

### TypeScript

Put any type or class declarations at the top of the file before the problems.
